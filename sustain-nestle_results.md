# Our approach
Nestlé is committed to developing products that are good for you and good for the planet. Our purpose is to unlock the power of food to enhance quality of life for everyone, today and for generations to come.

## A climate-centered approach
The climate crisis is exacerbating the global food crisis. Food and farming’s role in providing systemic solutions to an environmental crisis has never been better understood. We must continue to accelerate the shift toward providing systemic solutions to these challenges. 

We aim to halve our carbon footprint by 2030. To achieve that, we’re transforming every aspect of our business – from converting our trucks to alternative fuels and our factories to renewable electricity to introducing packaging that uses less plastic and can be more easily recycled and reused. 

Our approach is holistic and interconnected, built on our commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest, while supporting human rights and putting people at the center of everything we do.

## Advancing regenerative food systems at scale
Our intention to advance regenerative food systems at scale marks a profound development in our thinking. Each word in this phrase is important and addresses how we are accelerating our activities:

* Advance by raising our voice and using our influence to drive progress, in collaboration with others
* Regenerative to help protect, renew and restore farmland and landscapes
* Food systems encompassing every actor, activity, process and product involved in growing, raising, making, delivering and consuming food
* At scale because the planet, communities and individuals need global, systems-level change

## Transforming food systems and agriculture for a resilient future
By advancing regenerative food systems and working with farmers to help them transition to regenerative agricultural practices, we can help create a more resilient future for our planet and its people.

### Good for You strategy: contributing to balanced diets
Through our Good for You strategy, we aim to bring tasty and balanced diets within reach for billions, today and for generations to come. This includes a commitment to growing the nutrition value of most of our global portfolio, using the Health Star Rating (HSR) system as the basis to measure our progress. We leverage our decades of experience and our R&D expertise to offer safe, affordable and high-quality products for people everywhere and across all life stages. We are determined to develop products that are good for you and good for the planet.

### Supporting a just transition
Our aim is to provide resilient and fair livelihoods and dignified work that enable farming communities across the world to support themselves and their families. The path to regenerative agriculture is long. This is why we are helping farmers by providing financial support, remunerating good practices and offering technical and scientific guidance, through programs like the Nescafé Plan, Nespresso AAA Sustainable QualityTM Program and income accelerator program. This approach, along with the respect and promotion of human rights, is designed to contribute to a just transition to new practices throughout our supply chains.

### Restoring nature, protecting biodiversity
Supporting nature is central to regenerative farming practices and essential for addressing climate change. We are working to help safeguard natural resources, in particular forests, which support much of the planet’s biodiversity. We do this through landscape initiatives as part of our Forest Positive strategy and Global Reforestation Program, as well as initiatives dedicated to water stewardship, and by sourcing ingredients that are certified deforestation-free.

### Partnerships for change
Advancing regenerative food systems is about co-creating a resilient future for our planet and its people, working toward nurturing communities, improving the well-being of our consumers, and revitalizing natural ecosystems. The effort requires understanding and support from all actors involved, from governments, academia and NGOs to peer companies and competitors, financial institutions and commodity traders. We all have a part to play in helping make regenerative food systems a reality.

### Benefitting people, nature and the climate
By advancing regenerative food systems and working with farmers to help them transition to regenerative agricultural practices, we can help create a more resilient future for our planet and its people.

Paul Hawken Founder, Project Regeneration; Author, Regeneration: "Ending the Climate Crisis in One Generation Regenerative food systems are not aspirational, they are pragmatic. They benefit the entire supply chain, the whole of the company, and all of global society."

# Net zero roadmap
Solving the problem means identifying the problem. We found Nestlé emitted 92 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. Now we know the extent, we know the road ahead. 

## Measuring our carbon footprint
We take a whole life cycle approach to determining the carbon footprint of our products. It is a process that involves working with many others, such as farmers, logistics providers and consumers. To achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050, we need to act throughout our value chain.

## Out total emissions by scope
Emissions from our direct operations, known as Scope 1 and Scope 2, accounted for just 5% of our GHG emissions. The vast majority of our GHG emissions (95%) come from activities in our supply chain. As a result, that is where we focus most of our efforts.

## Our key actions at a glance

### Sourcing our ingredients sustainably
Working with farmers, suppliers and communities to source ways that protect ecosystems, reduce emissions and enhance livelihoods.

### Evolving our packaging
Packaging helps keep our food safe but causes waste. Investments in packaging innovations and new business models help keep waste out of landfill.

### Driving toward cleaner logistics
Optimizing routes, filling vehicles more efficiently, switching to low-emission fuels and renewable electricity and using more rail transport.

### Using the power of our brands and products
As consumers demand increasingly transparent and sustainable products, our brands will continue to adapt, embracing sustainability.

### Transforming our product portfolio
Creating new, low-carbon products, and reformulating existing ones using ingredients and processes that are good for both consumers and planet.

### Using renewable energy to manufacture our products
Making products more sustainably by switching to renewable electricity, using more renewable fuels and investing in energy efficiency.

### Removing carbon from the atmosphere
Using nature’s own solutions such as agroforestry, soil management, and restoring peatlands and forests to lock GHGs in the ground.

### Using our voice to galvanize action
Forging deep engagement on climate issues with farmers, industry, governments, NGOs and communities
